Then, roughly a thousand years ago, everything changed. A singular, inexplicable cosmic broadcast permeated every corner of the known galaxy, fundamentally altering the trajectory of every human species it touched. This Broadcast wasn’t a message; it was a download – a complete compendium of advanced technological knowledge. Within moments, humanity was gifted with the ability to traverse interstellar distances with FTL drives, to augment their bodies with bionics, to create loyal and intelligent robotics, and to achieve unprecedented breakthroughs in medical science.\nThis sudden infusion of knowledge propelled numerous human civilizations to a comparable level of technological advancement, bringing them into contact with one another on the galactic stage for the first time. The resulting proliferation of empires, federations, and free states has led to an era of both astounding cooperation and fierce competition. However, the true prize lies deeper within the broadcast’s data. Buried beneath layers of intricate encryption are the schematics for exotic technologies that defy current understanding, rumored to reshape reality itself. The clues to unlocking these ultimate secrets are scattered across the galaxy, sparking an all-consuming race among all human factions to decode them and claim unparalleled power.\nContents:\nThe Galaxy\nGalactic Civilizations &amp; Their Domains"}}
